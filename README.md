# 👋 Hi, I'm Zohaib Faruqui — aka FaruquiSahab

I'm a full-stack web developer from Karachi, Pakistan 🇵🇰, navigating the ever-evolving tech landscape with curiosity and a dash of humor. My journey began with the foundational trio: Core PHP, MySQL, and Laravel. Over time, I've expanded my toolkit to include Node.js (and its TypeScript variant), React, and Next.js.

While I might not be the go-to guy for pixel-perfect designs, I thrive in collaborative environments, seamlessly integrating into existing UIs and bringing functionality to life.

- **Framework Fluency**: Embraced Laravel for its elegance and efficiency in building robust applications.
- **Server-Side Scaling**: Transitioned to Node.js and NodeTS, developing scalable backend solutions.
- **Frontend Forays**: Ventured into React and Next.js, contributing to dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
